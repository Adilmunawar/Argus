Most "leave the cloud" write-ups are opinion pieces. This is the working record of an actual migration: thirty-three architecture decisions with the options weighed and the costs named, every application traced down to its service account and backup, a security architecture rooted in hardware, a hardware bill of materials, and a web console designed against AWS Cloudscape, Google Cloud and the Azure portal — with a tested prototype you can open in a browser.

It also says plainly what has **not** been proven. `docs/09-VALIDATION-STATUS.md` grades every claim as verified, grounded, reasoned or assumed, and lists the eleven assumptions most likely to be wrong. Read that before trusting anything else here.

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Replaces** | EC2, S3, RDS, Cognito, IAM, Secrets Manager, KMS, Lambda, SQS/SNS, ElastiCache, CloudWatch, X-Ray, ECR, CodePipeline, SageMaker |
| **Base** | Windows Server 2025 · Hyper-V · Failover Clustering · Storage Spaces Direct · Service Fabric · Active Directory |
| **Security** | Hardware root of trust, WDAC code integrity, IPsec domain isolation, no standing admin rights, object-locked backups at two sites |
| **Control** | A web console, a PowerShell module, and a GitOps repository that is the only writer of production |
| **Targets** | RPO 15 min · RTO 8 h for full site loss · 99.9% · under 10 min from `git push` to signed production deploy |
| **Exceptions** | Three Linux hosts, each justified by an ADR |

## Start here

1. [`docs/00-MASTER-PLAN.md`](docs/00-MASTER-PLAN.md) — what we are building, the targets, the phases.
2. [`docs/01-DECISIONS.md`](docs/01-DECISIONS.md) — **why** every component was chosen, what it replaces, what was rejected. Every future change to the platform starts as a new ADR here.
3. [`docs/02-APPLICATION-INFRASTRUCTURE-MAP.md`](docs/02-APPLICATION-INFRASTRUCTURE-MAP.md) — every application, down to the service account, bucket, port and backup that carries it.
4. [`docs/03-SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/03-SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE.md) — the controls, the threat model, the evidence.
5. [`docs/04-NETWORK-AND-SITES.md`](docs/04-NETWORK-AND-SITES.md) — zones, VLANs, addressing, the two sites.
6. [`docs/05-CONTROL-PLANE.md`](docs/05-CONTROL-PLANE.md) — the console, the CLI, the GitOps flow.
7. [`docs/06-PHASES-AND-RUNBOOKS.md`](docs/06-PHASES-AND-RUNBOOKS.md) — the schedule with exit gates; `docs/runbooks/` for the operational procedures.
8. [`docs/07-HARDWARE-AND-LICENSING.md`](docs/07-HARDWARE-AND-LICENSING.md) — bill of materials, Windows and SQL licensing.
9. [`docs/08-OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](docs/08-OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) — decisions still needed from the owner.
10. **[`docs/09-VALIDATION-STATUS.md`](docs/09-VALIDATION-STATUS.md) — what is actually tested and what is not. Read this before trusting any of the above.**
11. [`docs/10-CONSOLE-DESIGN.md`](docs/10-CONSOLE-DESIGN.md) — the web console: every screen, including browser RDP. Open [`platform/console/prototype/index.html`](platform/console/prototype/index.html) in a browser to see it.
12. [`docs/11-CONSOLE-UX-BENCHMARK-AND-BUGS.md`](docs/11-CONSOLE-UX-BENCHMARK-AND-BUGS.md) — AWS/GCP/Azure benchmark, the test suite, every bug found and the fix plan. `node platform/console/prototype/tests/run-tests.js` — currently 51/51.

## Before you buy anything

Run [`docs/runbooks/boot-01-day-one.md`](docs/runbooks/boot-01-day-one.md): a five-day lab on one spare machine that tests the three assumptions most likely to be wrong. It costs a Windows evaluation licence and a week. Ordering hardware first risks $85–110k against an untested design.

## Repository layout

```
docs/               the plan (read these first)
docs/adr/           one file per architecture decision, numbered
docs/runbooks/      operational procedures — one per failure or task
platform/console/   ZD Cloud Console (.NET 10 API + Next.js) — the web control surface
platform/cli/       ZDCloud PowerShell module + zdc thin CLI
platform/gitops/    desired state of the platform: apps, VMs, buckets, secrets refs, policies
platform/policies/  WDAC, GPO baselines, firewall/IPsec, Wazuh rules — enforced, versioned
platform/iac/       OpenTofu (Hyper-V provider) + DSC v3 for hosts and VMs
CHANGELOG.md        every change to the plan, dated, with the reason
```

## How changes happen

Nothing about this platform changes without a commit here. A new component, a removed one, a changed port, a rotated key policy: it is an ADR (`docs/adr/`), a line in `CHANGELOG.md`, and a change in `platform/`. `git log` is the history of why the platform is the way it is.

## Try the console

```bash
open platform/console/prototype/index.html          # no build, no server, no network
node platform/console/prototype/tests/run-tests.js  # 65 assertions in headless Chromium
```

The prototype is static, but the tests are real: axe-core WCAG 2.1 A/AA on every screen, keyboard traversal with actual `Tab` presses, contrast computed from rendered pixels, six viewport widths, and a density suite that asserts a 1366×768 laptop does not spend more than 55% of its screen on chrome.

## Relationship to other repos

- `Zarz001/Mills-Restructured-by-Zayan` — the first application to land on the platform (Phase 2).
- `adilmunawar/ZD-claude-plugin` — the team's Claude Code plugins; `zd-deploy`, `zd-ops` and `zd-security` are pointed at `platform/gitops/` and `docs/runbooks/`.
- `Adilmunawar/ZaraatDost-Models`, `AdilMunawar/sugarcane` — the ML pipelines that move to the GPU node in Phase 3.
