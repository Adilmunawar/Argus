# ZD Cloud — Master Implementation Plan

**A sovereign, self-hosted cloud platform for Zaraat Dost, built from the best open-source infrastructure on GitHub, replacing AWS end to end.**

Prepared 7 September 2026 · for Adil Munawar, Zaraat Dost (Pvt.) Ltd.

## 0. Read this first

Three things I need to say before the plan, because they shape every decision in it.

**"All of AWS" is the wrong target.** AWS has ~240 services. Zaraat Dost uses, by my audit of the Mills repo and what I know of the ML pipelines, about **14 capability areas**. A platform that tries to replicate 240 services is a platform that ships in never. A platform that replicates the 14 you use, brilliantly, with room to add the next 10, ships in a quarter and is *more* robust because there is less of it to fail. This plan targets the 14, and is designed so the 15th is an afternoon of YAML rather than a project.

**"Most advanced" has to mean something measurable.** I have written this plan against numbers, not adjectives:

| Property | Target |
|---|---|
| Recovery Point Objective (max data loss) | ≤ 15 min for databases, ≤ 1 h for object storage |
| Recovery Time Objective (time to restore service) | ≤ 1 h single-node failure (automatic), ≤ 8 h full-site loss |
| Availability of the public dashboards | 99.9 % monthly (≤ 44 min downtime) |
| Blast radius of any one compromised credential | one namespace, one tenant, ≤ 1 h TTL |
| Time from `git push` to production | < 10 min, with a signed, scanned, policy-checked image |
| Time to provision a new database / bucket / service | < 5 min, self-service, no ticket |

If a component in this plan does not move one of those numbers, it is not in this plan.

**The operational burden is real and must be staffed.** AWS's price includes people you never see: the ones replacing disks at 3 a.m. and patching hypervisors. Getting off AWS means hiring or training for that. Section 9 is honest about it. If that section is not acceptable, the right plan is a *hybrid* (Section 10), not a full exit.

One correction to my earlier compose file: it used MinIO. **MinIO's community edition was archived in February 2026** — no more security patches, no prebuilt binaries, and commercial use without an AIStor licence is a legal exposure. This plan uses SeaweedFS instead and treats MinIO as retired.

## 1. What Zaraat Dost actually needs

Derived from the Mills dashboard repo, the loan app, AGIS, the Expo mobile app, and the geospatial ML pipelines.

| # | Capability | AWS name | Today | Volume / shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Run long-lived services (.NET API, Next.js, YARP) | EC2 / ECS | One Windows EC2 box | 3 processes; small |
| 2 | Run Windows workloads (SQL Server, legacy LandSurveyApp) | EC2 Windows | Same box | Must survive the migration |
| 3 | Relational DB, geometry-capable | RDS | SQL Server `umairv3_db`, live under mobile apps | Single most critical asset |
| 4 | Object storage: survey photos, GeoTIFFs, Sentinel tiles, backups | S3 | `zd-daily-db-backups` bucket + local disk | **1.16 M** survey pictures (many small objects) + multi-GB rasters (few large) + ~3.2 TB retained backups |
| 5 | Backups with off-site copy | AWS Backup / S3 | Twice-daily to S3 | SIMPLE recovery → restore-to-last-full only |
| 6 | TLS termination, routing, one public door | ALB / CloudFront / ACM | YARP + Sectigo cert in Windows store | One origin, port 8443 |
| 7 | Human identity, MFA, roles (SuperAdmin, vendor scoping) | Cognito / IAM | JWT minted by the API, HMAC passwords shared with mobile apps | Cannot rehash passwords (mobile apps share the table) |
| 8 | Secrets (JWT keys, DB creds, Anthropic/ORS/GEE keys) | Secrets Manager / KMS | `appsettings.Local.json` + env vars; old secrets in git history | D16 rotation pending |
| 9 | GPU training + batch inference (SegFormer-B5, XGBoost v5 series) | SageMaker / EC2 GPU | Wherever you can get a GPU | Periodic, bursty, large rasters |
| 10 | Scheduled + event-driven pipelines (15-day Sentinel features, precompute) | Lambda / EventBridge / Step Functions | Cron and scripts | Recurring, must not silently fail |
| 11 | Queues / async work (shapefile ingest, exports, AI briefings) | SQS / SNS | Synchronous in the API | Rate-limited heavy admin ops |
| 12 | Cache | ElastiCache | In-process (192 MB geometry cache, etc.) | Small |
| 13 | Logs, metrics, traces, alerts | CloudWatch | WinSW log files | Nothing centralised |
| 14 | CI/CD, container registry, code hosting | CodePipeline / ECR / CodeCommit | GitHub + `package.ps1` / `update.ps1` | GitHub stays; build/deploy moves in-house |

Not on this list, because it will not be replaced: **Google Earth Engine** (crop monitoring), **Anthropic API** (Zaraat Dost AI), **OpenRouteService** (routing). Section 8 covers what "sovereign" means for those.

## 2. Reference architecture

### 2.1 The one-line answer

**Cozystack** as the platform substrate, on **Talos Linux**, on your own servers, in **two sites**, with a curated set of operators on top.

Cozystack is a CNCF Sandbox project that turns bare-metal servers into a private cloud: managed Kubernetes clusters, virtual machines, databases, object storage, load balancers and GPU workloads, from one Kubernetes-native REST API. v1.6.0 shipped in July 2026 with Talos-based tenant workers, tenant-controlled OIDC, a SecurityGroup firewall API and hierarchical quotas. It is the closest thing on GitHub to "AWS on your metal", and — critically — every piece inside it is standard upstream (Talos, KubeVirt, FluxCD, VictoriaMetrics, LINSTOR/Blockstor, Cilium/Kube-OVN), so if the project ever stalled you would keep running the same components without it.

Why not OpenStack? It *is* the traditional "private AWS", and it is enormous: a dozen interlocking services, a specialist ops team, and a Kubernetes-on-top story you would still have to build. For a team your size it is the wrong bet.

Why not plain Proxmox + k3s? Perfectly viable, and it is the fallback (2.4). But you would be hand-integrating 25 components that Cozystack has already integrated and tested together for hosting providers. Assembly is where private clouds die.

### 2.3 Layer map with chosen repositories

Every row: the AWS service it replaces, the GitHub project, why this one over the alternatives, and the licence (because 2023–2026 taught everyone that licences change).

#### Layer 0 — Host OS and virtualisation

| Need | Choice | Why | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node OS | **siderolabs/talos** | Immutable, API-only Linux built for Kubernetes. No SSH, no shell, no package manager — the attack surface of a router. Secure Boot + TPM-backed disk encryption. Upgrades are atomic and rollback-able. | MPL-2.0 |
| VMs for Windows (SQL Server, legacy API) | **kubevirt/kubevirt** (bundled in Cozystack) | Windows VMs scheduled beside containers on the same cluster, same storage, same network policy, same backups. | Apache-2.0 |
| Fallback hypervisor (Option B only) | **proxmox** | If Cozystack is rejected in the pilot, Proxmox VE + Talos VMs is the conservative path. | AGPL-3.0 |

#### Layer 1 — Networking and edge

| Need | Choice | Why | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Edge firewall / router | **opnsense/core** | HA pair (CARP), Suricata IDS/IPS, WireGuard, GeoIP blocking, traffic shaping. Replaces the EC2 security group *and* the missing perimeter. | BSD-2 |
| Collaborative threat intel | **crowdsecurity/crowdsec** | Bans IPs seen attacking anyone in the network; feeds OPNsense. Replaces AWS WAF's reputation lists. | MIT |
| CNI, network policy, encryption | **cilium/cilium** | eBPF datapath (fastest CNI), L3–L7 NetworkPolicy, WireGuard node-to-node encryption, Hubble flow observability. Every "who talked to whom" question answerable. | Apache-2.0 |
| Load balancer IPs on bare metal | **metallb/metallb** or Cozystack's built-in | Replaces ALB/NLB at L4. | Apache-2.0 |
| Ingress / API gateway | **envoyproxy/gateway** (Gateway API) | Envoy is what AWS ALB and most service meshes are built on. HTTP/3, rate limiting, JWT validation at the edge, WAF via Coraza. | Apache-2.0 |
| WAF | **corazawaf/coraza** | OWASP CRS engine, embeds in Envoy. Replaces AWS WAF. | Apache-2.0 |
| Certificates | **cert-manager/cert-manager** + **smallstep/certificates** (internal CA) | Let's Encrypt at the edge; a private ACME CA for every internal service. Replaces ACM. Also solves the Windows-cert-store problem in the gateway. | Apache-2.0 |
| Admin / developer access | **juanfont/headscale** (self-hosted Tailscale control plane) | Identity-bound WireGuard mesh. No VPN appliance, no open ports for admin. Replaces bastion hosts + Session Manager. | BSD-3 |

#### Layer 2 — Storage

| Need | Choice | Why | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Block storage (EBS) | **Cozystack Blockstor / LINSTOR** (bundled) or **rook/rook** (Ceph) | Blockstor: LVM/ZFS backends, DRBD replication, LINSTOR-compatible API, open-sourced by the Cozystack team in 2026. Choose Rook-Ceph only if you go past ~6 nodes or need unified block+file+object from one system. | Apache-2.0 |
| Object storage (S3) — primary | **seaweedfs/seaweedfs** | Apache-2.0, ~30 K stars, weekly releases, purpose-built for **many small objects** (your 1.16 M survey pictures are exactly its sweet spot), S3 API + lifecycle policies + erasure coding for warm data, mature Helm chart. | Apache-2.0 |
| Object storage (S3) — DR site | **deuxfleurs-org/garage** | Designed for small clusters over unreliable links, built-in multi-site replication, tiny resource footprint. The ideal off-site target. | AGPL-3.0 (fine: you are not distributing it) |
| Shared POSIX filesystem (EFS) | **CephFS** via Rook, or SeaweedFS FUSE mount | For the legacy `C:\IIS_Deployments\TempLocationSurvey` path pattern until the app writes to S3 directly. | LGPL / Apache-2.0 |
| Kubernetes backup (AWS Backup) | **vmware-tanzu/velero** | Snapshots PVs + manifests to S3 (SeaweedFS → Garage). Restore a whole namespace. | Apache-2.0 |
| File-level backup engine | **kopia/kopia** (or **restic/restic**) | Deduplicated, encrypted, content-addressed. Used by Velero under the hood and directly for the survey-picture tree. | Apache-2.0 / BSD-2 |

**Object-lock everywhere backups land.** Both SeaweedFS and Garage support WORM / object-lock semantics. Backups are written by a credential that can `PUT` but never `DELETE`. Ransomware that gets the API's credentials cannot touch yesterday's backup.

#### Layer 3 — Data services

| Need | Choice | Why | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL + PostGIS (RDS) | **cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg** | The best Postgres operator: streaming replicas, automatic failover, pgBackRest-style WAL archiving to S3 (RPO seconds), point-in-time restore, declarative. PostGIS image included. This becomes the home for parcels, mauzas, classifier feature tables, STAC catalogue. | Apache-2.0 |
| SQL Server (RDS for SQL Server) | **SQL Server 2022 on a KubeVirt Windows VM**, Always On availability group to Site B | Non-negotiable for `umairv3_db` today (procs, geometry, HMAC passwords shared with mobile apps). Licence: Standard edition per core, or Developer for non-prod. Long-term: migrate additive tables to PostGIS as OPEN-DECISIONS rule them. | Proprietary |
| Cache (ElastiCache) | **valkey-io/valkey** | The Linux Foundation fork of Redis after the 2024 relicensing. Drop-in. Externalise the API's three in-process caches so pods become stateless and can scale horizontally. | BSD-3 |
| Queue / streaming (SQS, SNS, EventBridge) | **nats-io/nats-server** (JetStream) | One binary: pub/sub, durable queues, key-value, object store, request-reply. Far lighter than Kafka, far more capable than RabbitMQ. Shapefile ingests, exports and AI briefings become async jobs. | Apache-2.0 |
| Analytics DB (Redshift / Athena) | **ClickHouse/ClickHouse** | Column store for season-over-season harvest analytics, surveyor productivity, per-parcel time series of Sentinel indices. Sub-second over billions of rows. | Apache-2.0 |
| Lakehouse (optional, Glue/Athena) | **apache/iceberg** tables on SeaweedFS + **trinodb/trino** | Only if the ML feature tables outgrow Postgres. Defer. | Apache-2.0 |

#### Layer 4 — Identity, secrets, trust

| Need | Choice | Why | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Human identity, SSO, MFA (Cognito, IAM users) | **keycloak/keycloak** | CNCF, OIDC + SAML, TOTP/WebAuthn/passkeys, fine-grained roles, user federation. Every dashboard, Grafana, Harbor, Forgejo, JupyterHub logs in through it. The Mills API keeps minting its own JWTs for the mobile apps (the password-scheme constraint) but validates Keycloak tokens for the web — a bridge, not a rewrite. | Apache-2.0 |
| Secrets, encryption keys, PKI (Secrets Manager, KMS, ACM Private CA) | **openbao/openbao** | Linux Foundation, MPL-2.0 fork of Vault, API-compatible; v2.6 (Aug 2026) added per-namespace sealing. Dynamic short-lived DB credentials (no more `sa`), transit encryption for the survey pictures, auto-unseal with the TPM. Directly resolves OPEN-DECISIONS D16. | MPL-2.0 |
| Secrets → Kubernetes | **external-secrets/external-secrets** | Syncs OpenBao into Secrets; apps never see OpenBao directly. | Apache-2.0 |
| Secrets in Git (for GitOps) | **getsops/sops** + **FiloSottile/age** | Encrypted config committed safely. Never again a `sa` password in git history. | MPL-2.0 / BSD-3 |
| Workload identity (IAM roles for services) | **spiffe/spire** (phase 5, optional) | Cryptographic identity for every pod; mTLS without shared secrets. | Apache-2.0 |
| Password manager for the team | **dani-garcia/vaultwarden** | Bitwarden-compatible server. Humans stop putting keys in WhatsApp. | AGPL-3.0 |

#### Layer 5 — Compute, delivery, registry

| Need | Choice | Why | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Serverless functions (Lambda) | **knative/serving** + **knative/eventing** | Scale-to-zero HTTP and event-driven containers. NATS as the event source. Your 15-day Sentinel feature job becomes a function triggered by a "new scene landed" event. | Apache-2.0 |
| Batch / DAG workflows (Step Functions, Batch) | **argoproj/argo-workflows** | Kubernetes-native DAGs with retries, artifacts to S3, GPU steps. The precompute pipeline and the training runs. | Apache-2.0 |
| Container registry (ECR) | **goharbor/harbor** | CNCF graduated. Vulnerability scanning on push (Trivy), image signing, replication to Site B, proxy cache for Docker Hub / ghcr (matters on Pakistani bandwidth). | Apache-2.0 |
| Git hosting mirror + CI runners (CodeCommit / CodeBuild) | **forgejo/forgejo** + Forgejo Actions (GitHub-Actions-compatible) | GitHub remains the source of truth for the public repos; Forgejo mirrors them and runs CI **inside** the private network so builds can reach the private registry, databases and GPUs. Your existing `api-ci.yml` runs unchanged. | MIT |
| Continuous deployment (CodeDeploy) | **fluxcd/flux2** (bundled with Cozystack) or **argoproj/argo-cd** | GitOps: the cluster's state is a Git repo; a merge is a deploy; a revert is a rollback. `update.ps1`'s stop-rename-swap-healthcheck-rollback dance becomes a Kubernetes rolling update with the same health gate. | Apache-2.0 |
| Developer platform portal (optional) | **backstage/backstage** | Service catalogue + golden-path templates once you have > 10 services. Phase 6. | Apache-2.0 |

#### Layer 6 — ML and geospatial platform

| Need | Choice | Why | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPU scheduling (SageMaker instances) | **NVIDIA/gpu-operator** + **Project-HAMi/HAMi** (bundled in Cozystack ≥ 1.4) | Drivers, device plugin, DCGM metrics; HAMi gives fractional GPU sharing so a JupyterHub session does not hog a whole L40S. | Apache-2.0 |
| Distributed training / inference (SageMaker Training) | **ray-project/ray** via **ray-project/kuberay** | Scales SegFormer training and tiled inference over rasters across GPUs and nodes; same code from laptop to cluster. | Apache-2.0 |
| Experiment tracking + model registry (SageMaker Experiments / Model Registry) | **mlflow/mlflow** | v5.x classifier lineage, metrics, artefacts (S3-backed), promotion stages. | Apache-2.0 |
| Model serving (SageMaker Endpoints) | **kserve/kserve** | Autoscaling inference endpoints on Knative; canary rollouts; the parcel classifier as a versioned HTTP endpoint the dashboard calls. | Apache-2.0 |
| Notebooks (SageMaker Studio) | **jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s** | Keycloak login, per-user GPU quota, S3 mounted. | BSD-3 |
| Pipeline orchestration (Glue / Step Functions for data) | **dagster-io/dagster** | Asset-based: "the 15-day feature table for Kishtawar, season 2026-27" is a versioned asset with lineage, freshness SLAs and alerts when it is stale. Better fit than Airflow for data assets. | Apache-2.0 |
| Satellite catalogue (no AWS equivalent — the sovereign replacement for hitting Copernicus/Earth Engine live) | **stac-utils/stac-fastapi** + **stac-utils/pgstac** | Local STAC index over a mirrored Sentinel-1/2 archive for Punjab and Sindh. Pipelines query "scenes over this AOI in this window" locally. | MIT |
| Raster tiles (no AWS equivalent) | **developmentseed/titiler** | Dynamic COG tiling: NDVI over a mauza rendered on demand for the dashboard map. | MIT |
| Vector tiles from PostGIS | **maplibre/martin** | Parcel boundaries as MVT straight from PostGIS; the map stops shipping megabyte GeoJSON. | Apache-2.0 |
| Sentinel mirror | **CDSE `openeo`/S3 pull via `eodag`** into SeaweedFS as COGs | Pull once, serve forever. On Pakistani bandwidth this alone changes pipeline latency from hours to seconds. | Apache-2.0 |

#### Layer 7 — Observability

| Need | Choice | Why | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Metrics (CloudWatch Metrics) | **VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics** (bundled in Cozystack) | Prometheus-compatible, ~10× less RAM and disk. | Apache-2.0 |
| Logs (CloudWatch Logs) | **grafana/loki** | Labels not full-text index → cheap at volume. Every WinSW log file, every pod, every VM. | AGPL-3.0 |
| Traces (X-Ray) | **grafana/tempo** + **open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector** | .NET and Next.js both ship OTel natively. See a slow dashboard request across gateway → API → SQL. | AGPL-3.0 / Apache-2.0 |
| Dashboards + alerting | **grafana/grafana** + Alertmanager → **caronc/apprise** | One login (Keycloak). Alerts to WhatsApp / Telegram / SMS — the channels your operations people actually watch. | AGPL-3.0 |
| Synthetic checks (Route 53 health checks) | **louislam/uptime-kuma** at Site B | Watches Site A from the outside. | MIT |
| Status page | **Uptime Kuma** built-in | For mill officers when something is down. | MIT |

#### Layer 8 — Security controls

| Need | Choice | Why | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Policy as code (SCPs, Config rules) | **kyverno/kyverno** | "No image without a signature", "no pod as root", "no service without a NetworkPolicy", "no PVC without a backup label". Enforced at admission; violations impossible, not just detected. | Apache-2.0 |
| Runtime threat detection (GuardDuty) | **falcosecurity/falco** | eBPF syscall monitoring: shell in a container, unexpected outbound connection, sensitive file read → alert in seconds. | Apache-2.0 |
| Vulnerability scanning (Inspector) | **aquasecurity/trivy** + **aquasecurity/trivy-operator** | Every image, every node, every IaC file, continuously. Harbor blocks pulls of images above the CVSS threshold. | Apache-2.0 |
| Supply chain (Signer) | **sigstore/cosign** + SBOMs (**anchore/syft**) | Every image signed in CI; Kyverno refuses unsigned images. Provenance for every binary in production. | Apache-2.0 |
| SIEM / host intrusion / compliance (Security Hub) | **wazuh/wazuh** | Agents on the Windows VMs and the edge; file-integrity monitoring; CIS benchmark checks; PCI/ISO mappings. Wazuh is where "advanced security" becomes evidence you can hand an auditor. | GPL-2.0 |
| Kubernetes hardening baseline | **aquasecurity/kube-bench** (CIS) + Talos defaults | Talos ships hardened; kube-bench proves it stays so. | Apache-2.0 |
| DDoS / abuse | CrowdSec + Envoy rate limits + OPNsense shaping | Layered. | — |

#### Layer 9 — The AWS Console

| Need | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Console | **Cozystack dashboard** (schema-driven since 1.4) + **headlamp-k8s/headlamp** | Self-service: a developer creates a Postgres, a bucket, a VM, a tenant Kubernetes from a form or a YAML. |
| CLI / IaC | `kubectl` + **opentofu/opentofu** (MPL-2.0 Terraform fork) for the edge + Site B | Everything reproducible from Git. |
| AI operator | Claude Code with your **zd-deploy** plugin pointed at the GitOps repo | The team already works this way. The platform being declarative is what makes it work. |

## 3. Security architecture

The word "advanced" is earned here or nowhere. This is a zero-trust design; the network perimeter is the *last* line, not the first.

### 3.1 Threat model (what we defend against, in priority order)

1. **Ransomware / destructive insider** hitting the database and backups together. → Object-locked, append-only backups at a second site under different credentials (§2.3 L2). Tested restore monthly.
2. **Credential theft** (a leaked `appsettings.Local.json`, a phished operator). → No long-lived credentials exist: OpenBao issues DB credentials with 1 h TTL; Keycloak sessions are MFA-bound; Headscale access is device+identity bound; every secret is revocable in one place.
3. **Compromised container / supply chain.** → Signed images only (cosign + Kyverno), scanned continuously (Trivy), read-only root filesystems, non-root, seccomp/AppArmor via Talos, Falco watching runtime, egress NetworkPolicy default-deny (a compromised pod cannot phone home).
4. **Lateral movement.** → Cilium default-deny between namespaces; every allowed flow is declared and Hubble-logged. SQL Server VM accepts connections only from the API's identity.
5. **Perimeter attack.** → OPNsense + Suricata + CrowdSec + Coraza WAF + Envoy rate limits (the API's own per-IP limiter stays as defence in depth).
6. **Physical theft / seizure of hardware.** → Talos full-disk encryption keyed to TPM; SeaweedFS volumes encrypted at rest; a stolen drive is noise.
7. **Loss of a site** (fire, flood, power, political). → Site B, ≤ 8 h RTO, drilled quarterly.

### 3.2 Controls matrix

| Control | Mechanism | Evidence it is working |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | Keycloak OIDC everywhere, WebAuthn/passkeys mandatory for admin roles, no shared accounts | Keycloak audit log → Loki → Wazuh |
| Secrets | OpenBao dynamic secrets, transit encryption, auto-unseal via TPM, quorum unseal keys held by 3 people | OpenBao audit device → Loki; monthly secret inventory |
| Network | Cilium default-deny, WireGuard node encryption, Envoy mTLS to backends, Headscale for admin | Hubble flow logs; NetworkPolicy coverage report (Kyverno) |
| Workload | Kyverno: signed images, non-root, no privileged, resource limits, required labels | Kyverno policy report; zero `warn` in prod |
| Runtime | Falco rules tuned per workload; shell-in-container pages on-call | Falco → Alertmanager → Apprise |
| Vulnerabilities | Trivy operator; Harbor blocks CVSS ≥ 7 unless waived with expiry | Harbor scan dashboard; waiver register |
| Host | Talos (no SSH, immutable, Secure Boot, TPM disk encryption); Wazuh agents on Windows VMs; CIS via kube-bench | kube-bench weekly; Wazuh FIM alerts |
| Data at rest | LUKS on Talos, SeaweedFS encryption, SQL Server TDE, OpenBao transit for survey photos' PII fields | Key inventory in OpenBao |
| Data in transit | TLS 1.3 at edge (HTTP/3), mTLS internal, WireGuard site-to-site | ssllabs-style check in CI; Hubble |
| Backup | Velero + kopia + pgBackRest + SQL native → SeaweedFS (object-lock 35 d) → Garage Site B (object-lock 90 d). Backup credential can write, never delete. | Monthly restore drill with a signed report |
| Change | GitOps only; no `kubectl apply` from laptops in prod (Kyverno denies non-Flux writers); every change is a reviewed PR | Git history is the change log |
| Audit | Kubernetes audit log + Keycloak + OpenBao + Wazuh → Loki, 1 y retention, at Site B too | Immutable; queryable |
| Incidents | Runbooks in the GitOps repo; on-call rota; blameless post-mortems | Post-mortem register |

### 3.3 The legacy exceptions, handled honestly

- **HMAC-SHA512 passwords shared with the mobile apps** cannot be rehashed (DECISIONS.md). Keycloak fronts the *web*; the API keeps its own login for the *apps*. When the apps get their next release, they move to Keycloak's OIDC PKCE flow and the HMAC table is frozen.
- **`sa` and the old keys in git history** (D16): rotation happens in Phase 2, the day the old API stops needing them; OpenBao holds the new ones and they are never written to disk by a human again.
- **The Windows VMs** are the softest targets. Wazuh agents, no inbound except from the API's identity, no internet egress except Windows Update via a proxy, Veeam-style VM snapshots via Velero + KubeVirt.

## 4. Performance architecture

"Fastest and smoothest" — where the milliseconds actually go, and what each choice buys.

| Bottleneck today | Change | Expected effect |
|---|---|---|
| Sentinel scenes pulled from Copernicus over Pakistani internet on every run | Local COG mirror in SeaweedFS + STAC index | Pipeline start: hours → seconds; reproducible |
| Multi-MB boundary GeoJSON per page load | Martin vector tiles from PostGIS + TiTiler for rasters + Envoy edge cache | Map first paint: 3–8 s → < 500 ms on office links |
| Three in-process caches pinned to one API instance | Valkey; API becomes stateless; 3 replicas behind Envoy | Horizontal scale; zero-downtime deploys; the hourly precompute no longer competes with requests |
| Sync shapefile ingest / exports blocking a request for minutes | NATS JetStream job queue + Argo Workflows workers | Instant 202 response; progress in the UI; retries |
| Single Windows box for everything | Dedicated NVMe for SQL Server VM, `MultipleActiveResultSets=False` preserved, read replica at Site B for reports | Report queries stop hurting the surveyor apps |
| GPU idle 90 % of the time / unavailable when needed | HAMi fractional sharing + Ray autoscaling + KServe scale-to-zero | Training when you want; inference always warm enough |
| Network | 25 GbE between storage/GPU nodes, 10 GbE elsewhere, Cilium eBPF (no iptables) | Storage-bound jobs saturate NVMe, not the NIC |
| Public edge | HTTP/3 + Brotli at Envoy; static assets cached at edge | Snappier dashboards on mobile data |

## 5. Hardware bill of materials

Prices are approximate USD for reference-class hardware as of mid-2026; verify with local vendors (Lahore/Karachi pricing varies ±25 %). Both tiers assume you already have rack space, cooling and a generator.

### Tier 1 — Pilot / starter (Site A only, ~3 months to production)

| Qty | Item | Spec | Est. |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Compute/storage nodes | 1U, AMD EPYC 9004 32-core, 256 GB ECC, 2 × 3.84 TB NVMe (OS + hot data), 4 × 20 TB SATA (SeaweedFS warm), 2 × 25 GbE, TPM 2.0, IPMI | $9–12 k each |
| 1 | GPU node | 2U, EPYC 24-core, 256 GB, 2 × NVIDIA L40S 48 GB (or RTX 6000 Ada), 4 × 3.84 TB NVMe, 2 × 25 GbE | $22–28 k |
| 1 | Switch | 48 × 10/25 GbE SFP28 + 4 × 100 GbE (e.g. Mikrotik CRS520 / used Mellanox SN2410) | $3–6 k |
| 2 | Edge firewalls | Small x86 with 4 × 10 GbE for OPNsense HA | $1.2 k each |
| 1 | UPS | 10 kVA online double-conversion + 30 min runtime, NUT-managed graceful shutdown | $5–8 k |
| — | Cabling, PDUs, rails, spares (2 NVMe, 2 HDD, 1 PSU) | | $3 k |
| | **Tier 1 total** | | **≈ $60–80 k** |

### Tier 2 — Production + DR (adds to Tier 1 over 6–9 months)

| Qty | Item | Est. |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Additional compute/storage nodes (Site A → 5, allows two failures) | $20–24 k |
| 1 | Second GPU node | $22–28 k |
| 2 | Site B nodes (compute + 6 × 20 TB, Garage + SQL replica + Velero targets) | $14–18 k |
| 1 | Site B switch, firewall, UPS | $8 k |
| 1 | Dedicated fibre / point-to-point or business ISP at each site | recurring |
| | **Tier 2 total** | **≈ $70–90 k** |

Versus AWS: an equivalent always-on footprint (a Windows EC2, an r6i for SQL, 2 × g5/g6 GPU instances 30 % utilised, 30 TB S3 + egress, backups) runs roughly $4–7 k/month in ap-southeast-1. Tier 1 pays back in ~12–18 months; the GPU nodes pay back fastest because on-demand GPU hours are the most expensive thing AWS sells you.

**Power is the design constraint in Pakistan, not compute.** Budget the UPS and generator interconnect first. Talos and Cozystack tolerate ungraceful power loss (etcd, DRBD, SeaweedFS are all crash-consistent), but SQL Server on a VM does not love it — the NUT-triggered clean shutdown of the Windows VM must be tested before go-live.

---

## 6. Implementation phases

Each phase has an exit criterion. Do not start the next until it is met. Total: **~9 months** to full exit, with AWS turned off at the end of Phase 5, not before.

### Phase 0 — Pilot (weeks 1–6)

Goal: prove Cozystack on your hardware, or reject it early for Option B.

- Procure Tier 1. Rack, cable, IPMI reachable over Headscale.
- Install Cozystack via PXE (talos-bootstrap). Three nodes, no GPU yet.
- Create tenants `zd-dev`, `zd-prod`, `zd-ml`. Enable: SeaweedFS, CloudNativePG, KubeVirt, VictoriaMetrics/Grafana, Flux.
- Deploy the `docker-compose.local.yml` stack from my previous deliverable **as Kubernetes manifests** in `zd-dev`: Mills API/Web/Gateway containers, SQL Server 2022 Developer on a KubeVirt Windows VM from a restored `umairv3_db` copy.
- Stand up Keycloak, OpenBao (auto-unseal via TPM), Harbor, Forgejo mirror of the GitHub repos with Actions runners inside the cluster.
- Run the first-boot checklist from `DEPLOYMENT.md` against the cluster deployment.

**Exit:** Mills dashboard fully usable in `zd-dev` against a restored DB; a `git push` to Forgejo builds, signs, scans and deploys in < 10 min; you can pull a node's power cord and the dashboard keeps serving.

**Decision gate:** if Cozystack fights you (installation, VM networking, storage), switch to Option B (§2.4) before Phase 1. Two weeks of pain is data; six is a mistake.

### Phase 1 — Storage and backups (weeks 7–10) — *first AWS cost disappears*

- SeaweedFS production buckets: `zd-survey-pictures`, `zd-rasters`, `zd-backups` (object-lock 35 d).
- Migrate the 1.16 M survey pictures and the raster archive into SeaweedFS with `rclone`; keep the legacy path served via a FUSE mount until the API reads S3 natively.
- Point the SQL backup job at SeaweedFS (the `backup-to-minio.sh` logic, retargeted; keep the `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` gate). Add pgBackRest for any Postgres.
- Stand up Site B minimally (one node, Garage, object-lock 90 d). SeaweedFS → Garage replication of `zd-backups`.
- **Restore drill #1:** rebuild `umairv3_db` from Garage at Site B, time it, sign the report.

**Exit:** two independent, object-locked copies of every backup at two sites; drill report on file; `zd-daily-db-backups` on S3 set to read-only.

### Phase 2 — Mills dashboard cutover (weeks 11–16)

- Promote the Phase 0 deployment to `zd-prod`. Envoy Gateway with cert-manager (Let's Encrypt) on a new hostname, e.g. `mills.zaraatdost.pk`; keep `zdost.aoserv.com:8443` alive as a redirect for 90 days.
- Externalise caches to Valkey; run 3 API replicas; move the hourly precompute to an Argo CronWorkflow.
- Keycloak fronts the web login; the API validates Keycloak tokens for web sessions, keeps HMAC for mobile.
- Legacy LandSurveyApp API lifted as-is into a KubeVirt VM (D22 says it must survive). Its 5 exports and static assets keep working through the same gateway.
- **Secrets rotation (D16):** new least-privilege SQL logins issued by OpenBao, `sa` disabled, ORS/Anthropic/GEE keys moved into OpenBao, old JWT key retired with the bridge when D1 is ruled.
- Full observability: OTel in the .NET API and Next.js; Loki for every log; SLO dashboards; Alertmanager → WhatsApp.

**Exit:** all dashboard traffic served from Site A for 2 weeks with 99.9 %; the EC2 Windows box is a warm standby only.

### Phase 3 — ML and geospatial platform (weeks 15–24, overlaps Phase 2)

- Add the GPU node(s); GPU operator + HAMi.
- JupyterHub, MLflow, Ray/KubeRay, KServe, Dagster in `zd-ml`.
- Sentinel-1/2 mirror for the Punjab and Sindh AOIs as COGs in SeaweedFS; STAC index in CloudNativePG (pgstac); TiTiler and Martin serving the dashboard map.
- Port the v5 classifier pipeline to a Dagster asset graph; SegFormer training as a Ray job; the parcel classifier as a KServe endpoint the dashboard calls.
- The 15-day feature-table job becomes event-driven: new scene in STAC → NATS event → Knative function → Dagster run.

**Exit:** one full season's feature table regenerated end-to-end on-prem, matching the current outputs; training run on the L40S faster than your current best.

### Phase 4 — Database and mobile apps (weeks 20–30)

The riskiest phase; it touches the surveyor phones.

- SQL Server Always On: primary in Site A VM, async secondary in Site B VM.
- The mobile apps' next release points at a DNS name you control (not `54.251.99.28`) with a TLS pin; old address kept alive as a TCP forwarder until adoption is > 95 %.
- Reporting queries moved to the Site B replica.
- Begin the PostGIS migration for additive tables as OPEN-DECISIONS rule them; the `ZD_CropShapes`-style satellite tables move first.

**Exit:** no client anywhere references the AWS IP; AWS SQL box powered off for 30 days with no incident.

### Phase 5 — DR and the AWS exit (weeks 28–34)

- Site B to full spec. Quarterly DR drill: fail Site A entirely, serve from Site B within 8 h, fail back.
- Decommission AWS: snapshot the EC2 (kept 90 days), delete the bucket after Garage retention proves out, close the account.

**Exit:** signed DR drill report; AWS invoice = $0.

### Phase 6 — Hardening and audit (weeks 34–40)

- External penetration test (a Pakistani or regional firm; scope = the public edge + a "assumed breach" internal test).
- Wazuh CIS/ISO 27001 control mapping; write the security policy documents against the evidence Wazuh and Kyverno already produce.
- Backstage or the Cozystack dashboard as the team's single console; golden-path templates for "new service", "new database", "new model endpoint".
- SPIRE for workload identity if the pen test asks for it.

## 7. Migration risks and mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `54.251.99.28` hard-coded in deployed mobile apps | High | Surveyor apps break | Phase 4 DNS + forwarder; app release first; adoption metrics before cutover |
| Cozystack is a Sandbox project with a small community | Medium | Slower support | Every component is upstream-standard; Option B exit path; pin versions; test upgrades in `zd-dev` |
| Power quality / load shedding | High | Corruption, downtime | Online UPS, NUT graceful shutdown, generator ATS; all storage crash-consistent; SQL VM shutdown tested |
| Team lacks Kubernetes depth | Medium | Slow Phase 0 | Hire one platform engineer (or contract) for Phases 0–2; the team already uses Claude Code — the GitOps repo is its natural interface |
| SQL Server licensing on-prem | Medium | Cost | Standard per-core for prod, Developer for everything else; plan the PostGIS migration |
| Off-site bandwidth for ~3 TB of backups | Medium | Site B lags | Incremental (kopia/pgBackRest) after the first seed by physical disk; Garage tolerates flaky links by design |
| Earth Engine remains external | Certain | "Sovereign" is partial | Phase 3's local Sentinel mirror + STAC makes 80 % of what GEE does for you local; keep GEE for the rest |
| Windows expertise vs Linux platform | Medium | Two skill sets | KubeVirt keeps Windows first-class; Wazuh covers both |
| Scope creep ("add another service") | High | Never ships | Phase gates with exit criteria; a new service enters through Backstage templates *after* Phase 5 |

---

## 8. What stays external, and what "sovereign" means for each

| Service | Why it stays | Sovereign posture |
|---|---|---|
| Google Earth Engine | Petabyte planetary archive + compute; no local equivalent | Local Sentinel mirror + STAC + TiTiler for everything Punjab/Sindh; GEE only for ad-hoc global queries; key in OpenBao; egress only via an allow-listed proxy |
| Anthropic API (Zaraat Dost AI) | The models are the product | Key in OpenBao; prompts and answers logged to Loki for audit; on-prem inference (vLLM on the L40S) as a fallback tier for the briefing feature if connectivity drops |
| OpenRouteService | 2,000/day quota, external | Self-host **GIScience/openrouteservice** with the Pakistan OSM extract in Phase 3 — it is Apache-2.0 and the quota disappears |
| GitHub | Public presence, the team's habit | Forgejo mirror is the build system of record; GitHub outage ≠ deploy outage |

---

## 9. Team, operations, cost of ownership

What AWS was quietly doing for you, and who does it now:

| Responsibility | Effort | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Platform engineering (Cozystack, Talos, storage, network) | 1 FTE Phases 0–2, then 0.5 | New hire or contractor, then Adil/Zayan |
| On-call for the platform | Rota of 3, one week each | Adil, Zayan, +1 |
| Security operations (Wazuh, Falco, Trivy triage, patching) | 0.25 FTE | Rotating, with Claude Code triage |
| Backup/DR drills | 1 day/month + 2 days/quarter | Platform owner |
| Hardware (disks, PSUs, vendor RMA) | Reactive | Platform owner; keep spares |
| Windows/SQL Server administration | 0.25 FTE | Existing DBA |

**Skill-building plan:** two weeks of Talos + Cozystack hands-on in Phase 0 for the whole team; the GitOps repo *is* the documentation; runbooks live beside the manifests; every incident produces a runbook update. Claude Code, with a `zd-platform` plugin holding the runbooks and cluster conventions, turns "what do I do when Falco fires X" into a five-minute conversation.

**Three-year TCO (rough):** hardware $150 k + one platform FTE $30–45 k/yr locally + power/connectivity $10 k/yr + SQL licences ≈ **$300–350 k** over 3 years, against AWS at $4–7 k/month ≈ $150–250 k *plus* the GPU hours you are currently not buying because they are too expensive. The financial case is decent but not overwhelming; **the real case is capability** (GPUs you actually use, data that never leaves the country, pipelines that run in seconds) **and control**.

---

## 10. If full exit is too much: the hybrid

Do Phases 0–3 and stop. Keep SQL Server and the surveyor apps' endpoint on AWS. You get: local GPUs, local imagery, local S3, local CI, zero-trust security, real observability, and an AWS bill that shrinks by roughly 60 % — without ever touching the phones. Phase 4 can wait a year.

---

## 11. Decisions I need from you

1. **Cozystack vs Option B** — I recommend Cozystack with a hard two-week evaluation gate. Agree?
2. **Site B location** — a second Zaraat Dost office, a partner mill's server room, or a rented rack in a Karachi datacentre? Each is fine; the choice changes the bandwidth plan.
3. **Current AWS monthly spend** — I estimated; the real number sets the payback timeline.
4. **SQL Server licence status on-prem** — do you hold Standard licences, or is this a new purchase?
5. **Who is the platform engineer** — hire, contract, or Adil/Zayan with training time carved out?
6. **Mobile app release cadence** — Phase 4 depends on shipping one release with a new DB endpoint.
7. **Appetite for the hybrid** (§10) as a checkpoint rather than an end state.

## Appendix B — Option B (if Cozystack is rejected in Phase 0)

Proxmox VE on each node → Talos Linux VMs for Kubernetes → Cilium → Rook-Ceph → the same operators from §2.3 installed by hand via Flux. Proxmox Backup Server replaces Velero for the Windows VMs. Roughly 3–4 extra weeks of assembly in Phase 0; identical from Phase 1 onward.

## Appendix C — What I did not put in, and why

- **Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd):** Cilium's mTLS and L7 policy cover 90 % of the value at 10 % of the complexity. Revisit if you pass 30 services.
- **Kubeflow:** Ray + MLflow + KServe + Dagster is lighter and each piece is best-of-breed; Kubeflow's value is bundling, which Cozystack's tenancy already provides.
- **Kafka/Redpanda:** NATS JetStream covers your event volumes by orders of magnitude; Kafka's operational weight is not justified.
- **OpenStack:** see §2.1.
- **LocalStack:** an emulator for developers; it never belonged in a production plan.
